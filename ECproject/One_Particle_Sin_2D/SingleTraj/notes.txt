Fist Bif:
    One stability multiplier crosses -1 along the real axis. no imaginary component. 
    The other multiplier was just negative tiny (not zero)
Second Bif:
    Second Bifurcatin point = .91875 +- .00005
    One stability multiplier crosses 1.0 on the real axis... no imaginary component. The other one
    didnt' plot --> should redo in order to look at the data file and see what the other actualy did
    (I think it was just tiny like in the first bif)
